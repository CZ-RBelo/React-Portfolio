      <p>
      As a tech-savvy front-end web developer, I have always had a strong gravitational pull towards technology.
With extensive experience in MS SQL and Oracle (T-SQL) database code development, now a Front Web
Development Certificate at Trilogy Education Services from London, I am gaining much-needed experience in web
development fundamentals while improving my skills in ES6 and Node.js, React State and Deployment, HTML5,
CCS, Bootstrap and JavaScript, jQuery, and APIs (Server / Web / Third-Party).
I am always striving to improve my skills and knowledge base. I consider communication and collaboration to be
fundamental parts of teamwork.
I intend to create and maintain websites, in addition to developing applications for iOS and Android.
I seek to bring my attention to detail and technical skills to a business to grow and become a valuable asset
