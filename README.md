## Contributing

Why you should contribute to an open-source project?  
Contributing to open-source is a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill.
You don’t have to contribute code, there’s always a task for you on an open-source project.
Besides coding, you can contribute to user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing.

Ways you can contribute:

* [Submit bugs and feature requests](https://github.com/CZ-RBelo/React-Portfolio/issues)
* [Review source code changes](https://github.com/CZ-RBelo/React-Portfolio/pulls)
